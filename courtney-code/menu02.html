        Whether you wear a cowboy hat or not, it’s irrelevant, the imagery of a cowboy is very powerful to people because we are living in times right now that are very divisive. I think we feel a bit powerless at times. Marginalised people, especially people of colour and queer people, we connect with cowboy imagery because it is innately rebellious, innately powerful. It’s an iconic image that shows it’s okay to be on the outside.

    “True country music is not about instrumentation, it’s not about the color of your skin, and it’s not about your sexual orientation. It’s about the crossroads of drama, storytelling, and sincerity.”
